### Starting Point Student Entrepreneurship Conference

 Going to a business conference as a designer I had very low expectations as it wasn't geared towards my skill set.  I went to four of the seminar classes and they were informative but didn't find them to be that helpful for me as a designer. 
 
 - Greg Curwin, President and CEO of TruLeaf talked about his indoor farming company and social entrepreneurship. He talk about how to take a current issue (food, shelter, energy, environment ect.) and marry it with profit for a successful business
 -Leslie Gallagher, a former student entrepreneur, ran a hands on workshop where participants were challenged to write down their goals, their business plan, what companies to get involved with and talk to, and who to network with. Although I don't have a business idea, this got me thinking about other career goals that I have.
 - Jordan Whalen, the president of Grey Smoke Media, talked about how to dominate social media. He made a point that being number one on Google search is of utmost importance.
 - Yien Ha-Watson and Adam Watson, a couple duo, presented on if you can in fact have it allâ€“both a career and a family. They both do believe that you can. 

For the most part I ended up enjoying the conference, it turned out to be a great networking experience. The part of the conference that was most useful was the idea swap. Through this myself and two of my group members from class were able to pitch our interactive aquarium idea and gain insights and unbiased opinions from people who knew nothing about our project.
 Through the idea swap I also met a handful of student entrepreneurs that needed or will need a designer in the near future. This allowed me to land a freelance project creating a logo and brand for a startup company.
